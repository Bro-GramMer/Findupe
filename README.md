# Image-Processing
This is an ML-based project which separates duplicate images from a bunch of images. [Still under development]

# How to use
```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -p PATH     source directory path
  -s          strict (only exact copies will be detected)
  ```

 
# Issues
The time complexity of finding and separating images is not the best, so I have to work on that.
